# AerionChallenge

A toad only moves forward, but it can move in steps that are 1 inch long or in jumps that 
are 2 inches long. The toad can cover the same distance using different combinations of 
steps and jumps.
  
Write a method that calculates the number of different combinations the toad can use to 
cover a given distance. For example, a distance of 3 inches can be covered in three ways: 
step-step-step, step-jump, and jump-step.
